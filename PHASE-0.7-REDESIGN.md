# Phase 0.7 — v3 iOS-Native Redesign + Story Share

> **Status: planning locked 2026-06-13.** The working tracker for the
> native-feel UI/UX revamp and the Instagram-story share feature.
> Triggered by repeat "still feels like a webapp" feedback. Supersedes the
> deferred LAUNCH.md 0.6.4 (parallel-route tab shell) — native transitions
> are handled here. Convention from AUDIT.md: **every shippable item has a Test.**

## Source of truth

- **Design package:** `../cinechrony ios redesign june/` (downloaded from
  Claude Design). `README.md` is the spec; `design_files/*.jsx` are
  HTML/React **visual references, not code to copy** — recreate in our real
  components. Fidelity is **final/high** per the handoff; imagery is the only
  placeholder (gradients → real TMDB posters/stills + R2 avatars).
- **Key insight:** v3 is an **evolution of the existing v2 editorial system**,
  not a rebrand. `globals.css` already has the oklch paper/bone/ink palette,
  film-red `--primary`, sage/amber/marker ratings, dark-mode tokens, and the
  three fonts (Bricolage / Space Mono / Newsreader). The 3-tab nav already
  matches. So this is **additive**, lower-risk than a from-scratch reskin.

## Locked decisions (2026-06-13)

1. **Sequence: look first, data rails fast-follow.** Restyle every existing
   screen to v3 + add the native-feel motion layer, using data we already
   have. The rails that need NEW backend (weekly leaderboard, top-picks
   categories, editor-featured carousel) come right after, not in the first
   merge.
2. **Presence pill: real data, no live presence.** Keep the pill; feed it from
   the existing `/activities` feed ("N of your circle logged films today/this
   week"). No "watching now" heartbeat system.
3. **Story share: share-sheet first, direct-to-IG fast-follow.** Build the
   card renderer + system-share-sheet path first (works web + iOS + Android,
   no Meta account). Get the free Meta App ID in parallel. Add the
   direct-to-Instagram-story native layer after, with share sheet as the
   permanent fallback (web always uses it). The attribution link sticker in
   the direct path is the growth lever — worth the App ID, but not a blocker.

## Verification (applies to every UI item — same as Phase 0.4.3)

The redesign is **presentational — it must not regress logic.** Each PR:
typecheck clean · `npm run build` (Vercel) clean · `npm run build:static`
(Capacitor) clean · **audit suite stays green** (403+/403+). Plus a manual
walk of the restyled flow in `npm run dev`, light + dark, and a Simulator
check for the native-feel items (haptics/transitions can't be seen in a
browser).

## Phase order

### 0.7.0 — Branch base ✅ DONE 2026-06-13

- [x] A+B merged to `main` (PR #88, tip `9c81360`); `feat/v3-redesign` branched
  off the fresh `main`. This is where all 0.7 work lands.

### 0.7.1 — Foundation: tokens + native primitives (no new data)

- [ ] **0.7.1.1** Extend `globals.css` + `tailwind.config.ts`: add `sunken`,
  `hair`, frosted `chrome` / `tabTint`, and the accent set (violet / blue /
  pink for leaderboard ranks + category dots). Keep all existing v2 tokens.
  Light + dark, values from `ios-kit.jsx::makeTokens`.
- [ ] **0.7.1.2** Frosted-surface primitive (`<Frost>`) — `backdrop-filter:
  blur() saturate()` over the tint. Verify it renders in the Capacitor
  WKWebView (it does; confirm on Simulator). Used by top bar / tab bar / nav bar.
- [ ] **0.7.1.3** Shared primitives to match the kit: `GlassBtn` (glass control
  over imagery), `Segmented` (sliding-thumb iOS control), `Section` header
  (eyebrow → title → trailing), `NavBar` (large lowercase title, collapses on
  scroll). Replace the `Fab` with the `AddBtn` (red round +) per design.
- [ ] **0.7.1.4** Theme wiring — `next-themes` (already in use) follows **system
  appearance by default** with a **manual override in settings** (decided
  2026-06-13, option c). Config, not a new dep; every screen supports both.
- [ ] **0.7.1.5 — Test:** render each primitive on a scratch route in
  `npm run dev`, light + dark; typecheck + build green.

### 0.7.2 — Native-feel motion layer (mostly visual-independent; can parallelize)

- [ ] **0.7.2.1** Install **`@capacitor/haptics`**; fire light impact on
  meaningful taps (like, save-to-list, add, tab switch, segmented switch,
  pull-to-refresh trigger) — no-op on web. (Closes the LAUNCH.md C.4.1 haptics
  item too.)
- [ ] **0.7.2.2** Native page transitions (push/pop slide + parallax) for
  pushed routes; replaces the deferred 0.6.4 tab shell. **Must respect the
  Vaul-drawer seam** — see `project-drawer-route-roundtrip` memory:
  BodyStyleWatchdog + the 220ms drawer-close defer stay in force; any
  transition work is tested against the modal→/comments→back round-trip.
- [ ] **0.7.2.3** Instant tap/press states on every interactive element; kill
  the gray iOS tap-highlight flash.
- [ ] **0.7.2.4** App-wide edge-swipe-back (generalize the existing
  `SwipeBackContainer` beyond `/comments`).
- [ ] **0.7.2.5** Scroll-collapse chrome (top bar / nav bar tint+blur+rule fade
  in past the scroll threshold) — already modeled in the design's `scrolled`
  state.
- [ ] **0.7.2.6 — Test:** real iPhone Simulator + ideally a device; feel-check
  taps/transitions/swipe-back; `prefers-reduced-motion` gates decorative
  animation.

### 0.7.3 — Screen-by-screen restyle (FIXED list, highest-traffic first)

> Maps design screens onto existing routes/components. Restyle only — same
> data, same logic. Posts/activity already carry `media[]`, ratings, captions
> → they feed the reel directly. `socialLink` + `video-embed.tsx` already
> handle attached clips. `favoriteMovies` → the "fav" badge + profile top-5.

- [ ] **0.7.3.1** **Home / feed** (centerpiece, `ios-home.jsx`): for-you /
  friends top tabs, in-feed search trigger (+ the red "scan" affordance →
  Phase C extractor entry point), the reel (presence pill [real data] +
  `DiaryEntry` from posts + `MediaGallery` + derived hot-take cards). Top
  picks / leaderboard / featured / lists-for-you render with **placeholder/
  existing-data sources** now; richer data lands in 0.7.5.
- [ ] **0.7.3.2** **Movie detail modal + movie-card variants** (grid / list).
- [x] **0.7.3.3** **Lists** (`ListsIOS`): album tiles + `MiniFan` poster fans +
  collapsing frosted NavBar + mine/shared segmented + AddBtn in the nav (FAB
  retired on this screen). Built `Segmented`, `NavBar`, `AddBtn`, `ListTile`
  primitives in context. All data/seed/refresh/create logic preserved.
  typecheck + build green. — first full-screen v3 restyle, awaiting green-light.
- [x] **0.7.3.4** **List detail** (`ListDetailIOS`): cinematic Hero (cover or
  seeded gradient + glass back/settings/add) → pull-up content sheet (serif
  description + collaborators row w/ "N collaborators · N films" + manage
  button) → to-watch/watched **Segmented** → existing movie grid (already 2:3
  posters + rating chips; view-modes/search/sort/modal all preserved). Built
  universal **GlassBtn** + **Hero** primitives (reused by Profile next). All
  collaborative-lookup / permission / seed / pull-to-refresh logic untouched.
  typecheck + build green. **Universal primitives now: Frost, Segmented,
  NavBar, AddBtn, ListTile, GlassBtn, Hero** + the existing MovieCardGrid is
  the canonical poster tile (kept, not duplicated → consistent card sizes).
- [x] **0.7.3.5** **Own profile**: cinematic Hero (seeded gradient + avatar
  overlaid + name/@handle/since + serif tagline + glass settings/sign-out) →
  pull-up content sheet (editable bio, find-friends/share pills, stats
  sandwich, **Segmented** tabs). Reused Hero + GlassBtn + Segmented. All edit
  logic preserved (avatar picker, inline bio, top-5 picker, follower/following
  modals, cover picker). Public profile (`/profile/[username]`) still pending.
  Also: persistent add **FAB** now on the lists tab. typecheck + build green.
  - **CORRECTION (re-read design):** the design's profile tabs are
    **`films · lists · activity`** (`ios-screens.jsx` ProfileIOS), NOT
    lists/shared/top-5. **films** = top-5 "canon" grid **+** a "recent"
    section (`RecentRow`); **activity** = the owner's full action feed.
    There is **no "shared" tab on the profile** — shared lists live on the
    Lists tab's `mine · shared` segment, and the **pending-invites banner
    moved to the Lists `shared` segment** (also still in /notifications). New
    universal `RecentRow` primitive (poster · badge · rating · title · meta ·
    chevron → opens movie modal). Recent/activity read the owner's
    `/activities` via a real-time `useCollection` query → **needs the new
    `(activities: userId ASC, createdAt DESC)` composite index in
    `firestore.indexes.json`; deploy with `firebase deploy --only
    firestore:indexes`** or recent/activity stay empty.
- [x] **0.7.3.5b** **Public profile** (`/profile/[username]`): same cinematic
  Hero (seeded gradient + avatar + name/@handle/since + serif bio tagline) +
  glass **back** (top-left) + glass **block/report ⋯** (top-right, new
  `ProfileOverflowMenu variant="glass"`) → content sheet (Follow + share pills,
  stats sandwich, **Segmented films · lists · activity**). lists tab uses the
  universal **ListTile** with the `ListLikeButton` (cover variant) in its
  likeButton slot; films = top-5 + recent; activity = `RecentRow` feed of the
  viewed user (world-readable `/activities` getDocs, same graceful try/catch).
  Wrapped in `MovieModalProvider`. **Dropped the old "shared" tab** — it never
  populated for other users (only the owner can list collaborative lists), so
  no feature lost. `ProfileListCard` is now orphaned (both profiles use
  ListTile) — safe to delete later. typecheck + build green.
- [x] **0.7.3.5c** **Profile-photo hero revamp** (both profiles, new mock): the
  **profile photo IS the hero** (full-bleed `coverImageUrl={photoURL}`), no more
  circular avatar. Eyebrow `critic · @handle · since` + lowercase name + serif
  tagline overlay the photo. `Hero` gained a `placeholder` slot (shown over the
  gradient when no cover) + sheen/scrim are now `pointer-events-none` so the
  empty-state affordance is tappable. Own profile: empty state = tappable "add a
  profile photo" → AvatarPicker; pills changed find-friends → **edit profile**
  (→ AvatarPicker) + share (find-friends still lives in Home search). Public:
  empty state falls back to the seeded gradient + name ghost. **Taste chips:
  real "N films" count only** (vibe tags like comedy/rom-com deferred — no
  genre/taste data model yet; would need an editable taste-tags feature). First
  tab kept as **films** (accurate to its top-5 + recent content). typecheck +
  build green.
- [x] **0.7.3.5d** **Edit-profile sheet** (mock 13): new full-screen
  `EditProfileSheet` (NOT Vaul — text inputs hit the iOS focus-trap bug) with
  cancel · save header. Photo hero preview + **change** glass pill + **camera
  roll** / **take photo** (file inputs, `capture="user"`) + **house avatars**
  (existing `DEFAULT_AVATARS`); name + bio inputs; one PATCH /me save. Reuses the
  avatar upload (`POST /me/avatar`) — extracted `compressAvatar` to
  `src/lib/avatar-image.ts` (shared with AvatarPicker). Extended **PATCH /me to
  accept `displayName`** (+ `displayNameLower`; denormalized copies resolve via
  the live profile cache, historical stay as-was). Profile now opens the sheet
  from the edit-profile pill, hero tagline, and the empty-photo placeholder;
  retired the inline bio editor + AvatarPicker usage on the profile.
  **Handle is read-only** — usernames are permanent (AUDIT 2.3) + denormalized
  widely; a once-a-year change is a deliberate backend feature (uniqueness +
  rate-limit + accepted historical staleness), offered as a follow-up rather
  than shipped silently. typecheck + build green.
- [x] **0.7.3.5e** **Top-5 picker revamp** (mocks 14+15): new full-screen
  `TopFivePicker` (replaces `FavoriteMoviesPicker`, now orphaned). **Sheet mode**:
  cancel·save header, serif subtitle, 5 ranked slots with **drag-to-rank**
  (custom pointer-events reorder — no new dep), rank badge + × remove, empty
  slots → search; "N of 5 picked · M spots open"; search trigger; **suggested
  for you** (trending). **Search mode** (tap the field): live `searchTmdbMulti`
  (films+tv) with **all · films · tv** pills, a YOUR CANON mini-row, each
  result's **+** drops into the next open slot, **done** returns. Saves the
  existing `FavoriteMovie[]` via PATCH /me (no schema change; dedup by tmdbId).
  Search meta is **year · film/tv** (genre/director need per-item detail
  fetches — omitted for cost). typecheck + build green.
- [~] **0.7.2** **Native-feel motion layer — slice 1 (haptics)**: installed
  `@capacitor/haptics@8`; `src/lib/haptics.ts` `haptic(kind)` helper (dynamic
  import, native-only, web no-op). Wired into the shared primitives so the whole
  app inherits it: **Segmented** (selection on switch; thumb already springs;
  bumped h-30→h-34), **Fab** (medium tap / heavy long-press), **GlassBtn**
  (light), **bottom-nav** (selection + `active:scale-90` press). Plus success
  on edit-profile + top-5 saves, selection on top-5 add and on each drag-rank
  crossing, light on remove. **Owner: run `npx cap sync` so the native build
  picks up the plugin.** Still TODO in 0.7.2: page push/pop transitions +
  app-wide swipe-back (the heavier motion piece). typecheck + build + static ✓.
- [x] **0.7.3.5f** **"your people" sheet** (mocks 17+18): new full-screen
  `PeopleSheet` replacing the two Card modals on both profiles. Eyebrow
  (@subject) + "your people" + ×, **Segmented followers/following** (with
  counts, inherits haptics+spring), search field (client-side filter), rows =
  ProfileAvatar + name/@handle/bio + **FollowButton** + tap-to-profile.
  **FollowButton restyled to a v3 pill** (universal): film-red filled for
  follow / follow-back, tonal + ✓ for following, lowercase, size-aware, haptic
  on toggle. **Zero per-row status fetches** — every row's relationship is
  pre-resolved from the viewer's own follower/following sets (loaded once; on
  the owner's own profile those ARE the subject lists → no extra calls). Meta
  is the person's **bio** (real); films-count / mutual-count deferred (no cheap
  aggregation). Removed Card/ProfileAvatar/Link/X usage from the profiles.
  typecheck + build ✓.
- [x] **0.7.3.5g** **Share profile — canonical URL fix.** The share was using
  `window.location.origin`, which in the native app is the Capacitor WebView
  origin (`capacitor://localhost`) → a **dead link**, and is also exposed to the
  `cinechrony.vercel.app` vs live `movienight-kappa.vercel.app` domain mismatch.
  New `src/lib/share.ts` (`shareOrigin()` + `profileShareUrl(username)`) resolves
  a real public https origin (NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL → NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL →
  Vercel preview→prod → `window.location.origin`), so a shared link opens on the
  web AND triggers the Universal Link into the app. Both profiles' `handleShare`
  now use it + `haptic('light')` + friendlier share text. **Rich per-user
  iMessage/OG card deliberately deferred to 0.7.4** — a personalized link preview
  needs server-rendered per-user OG metadata (conflicts with the static SPA
  shell) + a generated OG image = the exact same infra as the story cards. Build
  it once there, not as a throwaway half-version now. typecheck + build ✓.
  > **✅ Profile tab family complete** — photo hero · films/lists/activity tabs ·
  > edit-profile sheet · top-5 picker · your-people sheet · canonical share.
  > Plus the app-wide density pass + haptics motion slice. Two deliberate
  > deferrals carried forward: editable handle (backend feature) and rich share
  > cards (0.7.4).
- [x] **0.7.3.6** **Search** (`SearchIOS`): rebuilt the home search overlay
  (`search-overlay.tsx`, in place — the home trigger wiring is untouched) into
  a three-view discovery surface. **Discover** (empty query): **recommended for
  you / "from what you've watched"** — a horizontal poster row flattened from
  the existing **`GET /api/v1/recommendations`** (already reads the viewer's
  ratings: loved ≥8 → liked ≥6.5 → most-recent), round-robined across bases so
  the first cards show variety, each carrying its own tier-voiced reason ("you
  loved …" / "because you liked …" / "because you watched …" — reason text
  moved server-side into `getRecommendationsForUser`). Section hides for
  no-history users (no fake "from what you've watched"). **browse by vibe** —
  serif-italic keyword chips from a new shared `src/lib/vibes.ts` (9 curated
  vibes); tapping → a vibe-results grid via new **`GET /api/v1/movies/vibe/[vibeId]`**
  → `discoverByVibe()` which resolves the term to a TMDB keyword id at runtime
  (`/search/keyword` → `/discover/movie?with_keywords=…&sort_by=vote_count.desc`)
  and falls back to a plain movie search so a vibe never renders empty. **now &
  next** — a v3 **Segmented** (in theatres / coming soon) over two new public
  proxies **`GET /api/v1/movies/now-playing`** + **`/upcoming`** (`getNowPlayingMovies`
  / `getUpcomingMovies`; upcoming filtered to future releases). **Results** view
  (typed query) restyled to v3 (films/tv grid + people + lists) — same TMDB +
  user + list search as before. Discover data loads once per session and is
  kept across open/close; vibe results are cached per-vibe; haptics on chip tap
  / close / segmented. New endpoint types imported `import type` only (no server
  code in the client bundle — static build verified). typecheck ✓ · build ✓ ·
  static ✓ · audit **403/403**. **`/api/v1/movies/genres` was NOT needed** —
  the design's "genre chips" are the vibe/keyword chips, which read better than
  raw TMDB genres.
  - **Revision (2026-06-14):** moved now-playing / upcoming / vibe from
    `/api/v1/*` proxies to **client-direct TMDB calls** (`tmdb-client.ts`, same
    precedent as `searchTmdbMulti`); removed the 3 server routes + helpers.
    They're public, non-secret, non-user-scoped reads — proxying them only added
    a deploy dependency (the new routes 404'd on a Vercel **preview** because the
    preview client calls the *production* API origin — see
    [[project_preview_calls_prod_api]] — and prod didn't have the unmerged
    routes). Client-direct → works on web + preview + native + localhost with no
    round-trip. **Recommendations stays server-side** (reads ratings via admin
    SDK; already on prod). Also swapped 3 dead-keyword vibes for neo-noir /
    nonlinear / whodunit (verified populated), and put **people first** in
    results. typecheck ✓ · build ✓ · static ✓.
- [ ] **0.7.3.7** Auth / onboarding / notifications / settings: apply the
  system (lower traffic; coordinate onboarding with Phase C.7 later).
- [ ] **0.7.3.8 — Test:** per screen — light/dark walk in `npm run dev`,
  audit suite green, build green; Simulator pass on the hero screens.

### 0.7.4 — Story share: card renderer + share sheet (ships with redesign)

- [ ] **0.7.4.1** **Card renderer** — server-side via **`@vercel/og` (Satori)**
  at **1080×1920**, three layouts (`StoryReview` / `StoryWatched` /
  `StoryList` from `ios-story.jsx`). Lives as a Vercel API route (static
  export moves `/api` aside → native app fetches the PNG from Vercel, same as
  every `/api/v1` call). Embed the three fonts as buffers; **port card colors
  oklch → hex** (Satori's CSS engine; no backdrop-filter/grid). Real inputs:
  TMDB poster/backdrop, rating, list posters, handle.
- [ ] **0.7.4.2** **Share-sheet delivery** — install **`@capacitor/share`**;
  generate the PNG → hand to the OS share sheet (native) / Web Share API
  (web). Add a **"share to story"** action on post, review, and list surfaces.
- [ ] **0.7.4.3 — Test:** `45-story-card.test.ts` — renderer returns a valid
  1080×1920 PNG for each layout + auth/ownership on the endpoint; manual:
  share a card to IG via the sheet on web + Simulator.

### 0.7.5 — Data-rail fast-follow (the deferred backend)

- [ ] **0.7.5.1** Weekly leaderboard — films-watched-per-followed-user over 7
  days (aggregate over `/activities` within the follow graph). **Test:** seed
  activity, assert ranking + counts; block-filtered.
- [ ] **0.7.5.2** Top-picks categories — define + query `new` (fresh logs),
  `trending` (exists), `popular` (all-time loved), `lowkey` (hidden gems).
- [ ] **0.7.5.3** Featured carousel — lean on the Phase 0.5 loved-lists
  showcase + a manual `staffPick` flag for editorial slots.
- [ ] **0.7.5.4** Hot-take cards — selection rule over short, high-rated
  reviews. Presence pill final wording from real activity.

### 0.7.6 — Story share: direct-to-Instagram (native fast-follow)

- [x] **0.7.6.1** (OWNER) Meta app created. **App ID = `4465137393764764`**
  (app "cinechrony"). Sharing-to-Stories is **no-review** — just needs this
  registered App ID. Owner to finish basic settings + flip to Live before
  shipping: Privacy URL `https://cinechrony.vercel.app/privacy`, Terms URL
  `https://cinechrony.vercel.app/terms` (both are real public routes), app
  icon, category. **Ignore the "Manage messaging & content on Instagram" use
  case — that's the Graph API path (App Review + business verification), NOT
  needed for story sharing.** App PUBLISHED/Live in Meta 2026-06-13. URLs use
  the live PWA domain `https://movienight-kappa.vercel.app/{privacy,terms}`.

> ⚠️ **Domain discrepancy to resolve before native/Phase C** (not blocking the
> redesign): the live PWA is **`movienight-kappa.vercel.app`**, but
> `capacitor.config.ts` allowNavigation + PHASE-B-HANDOFF + the planned
> `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` reference **`cinechrony.vercel.app`**. The iOS
> bundle + deep links + AASA must point at the REAL live API origin (or a
> finalized custom domain like cinechrony.com) before TestFlight. Flag for the
> Phase B owner-setup pass.
- [ ] **0.7.6.2** Small custom Capacitor plugin: write PNG to pasteboard under
  Instagram's keys + open `instagram-stories://share?source_application=<AppID>`
  (iOS) / `com.instagram.share.ADD_TO_STORY` intent (Android). `Info.plist`
  `LSApplicationQueriesSchemes: instagram-stories`. Set the content URL to a
  Cinechrony deep link (the tappable attribution sticker = the growth lever).
- [ ] **0.7.6.3** Wire "share to story" → direct path on native, share sheet
  fallback on web / no-IG. **Test:** Simulator/device — card lands in IG story
  composer with the link sticker; web still falls back cleanly.

---

## New dependencies & owner tasks

- npm: `@capacitor/haptics`, `@capacitor/share`, `@vercel/og` (Satori). Run
  through `.npmrc` (legacy-peer-deps already set) and re-run `npx cap sync`.
- Fonts as buffers for the OG renderer (Bricolage Grotesque, Newsreader,
  Space Mono — already used; bundle the .ttf/.woff for server rendering).
- OWNER: Meta App ID (0.7.6.1) — free, no review, ~10 min, needed only before
  0.7.6.

## Sequencing vs other work

This is the **active priority, before Phase C** (the hero extractor). The
in-feed "scan" affordance (0.7.3.1) is the natural future entry point for the
Phase C extractor — so the redesign leaves a hook for it. Professional-
practices backlog (Sentry/PostHog/CI — LAUNCH D.0.x) still slots in after.

*Decision log: native-feel polish prioritized 2026-06-13; three scope
decisions locked same day (this doc). Design package downloaded 2026-06-13.*
