# Cinechrony Launch Plan — App Stores + Hero Feature + Marketing

> **Started:** 2026-05-15
> **Goal:** Ship to iOS App Store + Google Play with the screenshot-to-watchlist Share Extension as the hero feature, plus automated TikTok-first / Instagram-second daily content.
> **Sequencing:** This runs **after `AUDIT.md` Phase 1** completes (auth foundation is required by the refactor in Phase A below). Phase A naturally folds in the rest of AUDIT.md Phase 1 — closing both at once.
> **Approach:** Capacitor (right path — static export + API routes refactor). Not a Swift rewrite. Solo dev using Claude Code for Swift work.

---

## How we test (carries over from `AUDIT.md`)

Same conventions as the audit tracker:
1. **API contract tests** — for every refactored endpoint, a script in `scripts/audit-tests/` calls it as authenticated user / unauthenticated / wrong user. Captured as regression tests.
2. **Build verification** — `npm run build` (static export) succeeds; `npx cap sync` succeeds; Xcode + Android Studio builds succeed.
3. **Device testing** — real iPhone + real Android device via TestFlight / internal Play track. Simulator is a starting point but not sufficient for Share Extension or push notifications.
4. **End-to-end** — a checklist per phase describing the user-visible flow that must work.

---

## Phase A — Foundation: Server Actions → API routes (prep for static export)

> **This is the biggest single block of work.** ~30-40 endpoints to convert. Folds in `AUDIT.md` Phase 1 (auth helper applied per endpoint as we go). Roughly 2-3 weeks if focused.

### A.1 — Inventory & grouping

- [ ] **A.1.1** Categorize every export in `src/app/actions.ts`:
  - **Write actions** → must become API routes (mutations need server-side auth + Admin SDK)
  - **Server-only reads** (use Admin SDK or external APIs like TMDB/OMDB) → API routes
  - **Client-callable reads** already using Firestore Web SDK via `useCollection`/`useDoc` → no change needed
  - **Dead** (legacy `addMovie`, etc.) → delete
- [ ] **A.1.2** Output: a checklist file `scripts/api-refactor-inventory.md` with each action labeled and the target route name. Saves you from forgetting any.

### A.2 — Build the API route foundation

- [ ] **A.2.1** Create `src/lib/auth-server.ts` — `verifyCaller(req): Promise<{ uid }>` reads Firebase ID token from `Authorization: Bearer ...` header, calls `getAuth(adminApp).verifyIdToken(token)`. Throws `UnauthorizedError`.
- [ ] **A.2.2** Create `src/lib/api-handler.ts` — wrapper that handles: JSON parsing, calling `verifyCaller`, error envelope (`{ ok: false, error }` vs `{ ok: true, data }`), CORS headers for the Capacitor `capacitor://localhost` origin.
- [ ] **A.2.3** Create `src/lib/api-client.ts` (client-side) — `apiCall(endpoint, body)` helper that attaches the ID token from `auth.currentUser.getIdToken()`, calls the route, parses the envelope. **Replaces every existing Server Action call site.**
- [ ] **A.2.4 — Test:** `scripts/audit-tests/A2-auth-wrapper.test.ts` — request without token → 401, expired token → 401, valid token → handler receives correct `uid`.

### A.3 — Convert endpoints (one per route file)

> Group by domain. Each route file under `src/app/api/v1/...`. Numbered checklist matches the inventory in A.1.

**Lists**
- [ ] **A.3.1** `POST /api/v1/lists` — `createList`
- [ ] **A.3.2** `PATCH /api/v1/lists/[listId]` — `updateList` (name, isPublic)
- [ ] **A.3.3** `DELETE /api/v1/lists/[listId]` — `deleteList`
- [ ] **A.3.4** `POST /api/v1/lists/[listId]/transfer` — `transferOwnership` (transactional — closes AUDIT.md 2.1 + 1.3)
- [ ] **A.3.5** `POST /api/v1/lists/[listId]/cover` — `updateListCover` (closes AUDIT.md 1.5)

- [ ] **A.3.13** `POST /api/v1/invites` — `inviteToList`
- [ ] **A.3.14** `POST /api/v1/invites/link` — `createInviteLink` (CSPRNG code — closes AUDIT.md 2.9)
- [ ] **A.3.15** `POST /api/v1/invites/[code]/accept` — `acceptInvite` (transactional — closes AUDIT.md 1.11)
- [ ] **A.3.16** `POST /api/v1/invites/[code]/decline` — `declineInvite`
- [ ] **A.3.17** `DELETE /api/v1/invites/[id]` — `revokeInvite` (owner OR inviter — closes AUDIT.md 1.12)
- [ ] **A.3.18** `GET /api/v1/invites/[code]` — `getInviteByCode` (require auth — closes AUDIT.md 2.9 enumeration vector)

**User**
- [ ] **A.3.19** `PATCH /api/v1/me` — `updateProfile` (bio, photo, favorites, displayName)
- [ ] **A.3.20** `PATCH /api/v1/me/username` — `updateUsername` (transactional w/ reservation + usernameLower — closes AUDIT.md 1.10)
- [ ] **A.3.21** `DELETE /api/v1/me` — `deleteUserAccount` (closes AUDIT.md 1.2 + 2.7)
- [ ] **A.3.22** `POST /api/v1/me/avatar` — `uploadAvatar` (verified UID as R2 key — closes AUDIT.md 1.1 segment)
- [ ] **A.3.23** `POST /api/v1/me/push-subscription` — `savePushSubscription`
- [ ] **A.3.24** `DELETE /api/v1/me/push-subscription` — `removePushSubscription`
- [ ] **A.3.25** `POST /api/v1/me/notification-preferences` — `updateNotificationPreferences`

**Follows**
- [ ] **A.3.26** `POST /api/v1/users/[uid]/follow` — `followUser` (with rate limit — closes AUDIT.md 3.8 segment)
- [ ] **A.3.27** `DELETE /api/v1/users/[uid]/follow` — `unfollowUser`

**Reviews & ratings**
- [ ] **A.3.28** `POST /api/v1/reviews` — `createReview` (length cap, sanitize — closes AUDIT.md 2.16 segment)
- [ ] **A.3.29** `PATCH /api/v1/reviews/[id]` — `updateReview` (real edit — closes AUDIT.md 2.6)
- [ ] **A.3.30** `DELETE /api/v1/reviews/[id]` — `deleteReview` (also cleans activities)
- [ ] **A.3.31** `POST /api/v1/reviews/[id]/like` — `likeReview` (transactional — closes AUDIT.md 3.5)
- [ ] **A.3.32** `DELETE /api/v1/reviews/[id]/like` — `unlikeReview`
- [ ] **A.3.33** `GET /api/v1/reviews?tmdbId=...&cursor=...` — `getMovieReviews` w/ pagination (closes AUDIT.md 3.10)
- [ ] **A.3.34** `POST /api/v1/ratings` — `createOrUpdateRating`
- [ ] **A.3.35** `DELETE /api/v1/ratings/[tmdbId]` — `deleteRating`

**Activities**
- [ ] **A.3.36** `GET /api/v1/activities?cursor=...` — `getActivityFeed`
- [ ] **A.3.37** `POST /api/v1/activities/[id]/like` — `likeActivity` (transactional)

**Notifications**
- [ ] **A.3.38** `GET /api/v1/notifications` — list
- [ ] **A.3.39** `POST /api/v1/notifications/read` — `markNotificationsRead`

**Search & external**
- [ ] **A.3.40** `GET /api/v1/users/search?q=...` — `searchUsers` w/ prefix query (closes AUDIT.md 2.8)
- [ ] **A.3.41** `GET /api/v1/movies/search?q=...` — TMDB proxy
- [ ] **A.3.42** `GET /api/v1/movies/[tmdbId]` — TMDB details
- [ ] **A.3.43** `GET /api/v1/movies/[tmdbId]/imdb-rating` — OMDB proxy

**Admin**
- [ ] **A.3.44** `POST /api/v1/admin/backfill-movies` — strict `ADMIN_SECRET` (closes AUDIT.md 1.8)
- [ ] **A.3.45** Other backfill routes — same hardening

**Per-endpoint test pattern:** for each route, add `scripts/audit-tests/<route>.test.ts` covering: unauth → 401, wrong user → 403, correct user → 200, invalid input → 400. Standardize via a helper.

### A.4 — Update client call sites

- [ ] **A.4.1** Replace every `import { actionName } from '@/app/actions'` with `apiCall('endpoint', body)`. Search-and-replace pass per endpoint.
- [ ] **A.4.2** Delete `src/app/actions.ts` (or keep as a thin re-export during transition).
- [ ] **A.4.3 — Test:** all existing UI flows work in `npm run dev` against the new routes.

### A.5 — Static export config

- [ ] **A.5.1** Set `output: 'export'` in `next.config.ts`. Configure `images.unoptimized: true` (already done).
- [ ] **A.5.2** Identify any pages still using `getServerSideProps`-equivalent server features or RSC fetching — convert to client-side.
- [ ] **A.5.3** Resolve dynamic route handling for static export — `/lists/[listId]`, `/profile/[username]`, etc. (use `generateStaticParams` returning `[]` + `dynamicParams: true` won't work for export; use a single client-side router pattern instead). May need to introduce a catch-all client-rendered router.
- [ ] **A.5.4** `npm run build` outputs a clean `out/` directory.
- [ ] **A.5.5 — Test:** serve `out/` with a static server (e.g. `npx serve out`); every route works as a client-side app.

---

## Phase B — Capacitor wrap

> ~1 week. Mostly setup + configuration + handling WKWebView quirks.

### B.1 — Install & init

- [ ] **B.1.1** `npm install @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli @capacitor/ios @capacitor/android`
- [ ] **B.1.2** `npx cap init Cinechrony com.cinechrony.app --web-dir=out`
- [ ] **B.1.3** Configure `capacitor.config.ts`: app ID, name, `webDir: 'out'`, deep link scheme, allowed navigation domains.
- [ ] **B.1.4** Add iOS and Android platforms: `npx cap add ios && npx cap add android`.
- [ ] **B.1.5** `npm run build && npx cap sync` — produces working Xcode and Android Studio projects.

### B.2 — Auth in Capacitor

> Firebase Auth Web SDK has known issues in WKWebView (popup auth, OAuth redirects). Plan around it.

- [ ] **B.2.1** Decide: use Firebase Auth Web SDK with redirect flow (works but fragile), or use `@capacitor-firebase/authentication` plugin (more reliable, native auth dialogs).
  - **Recommended:** Capacitor Firebase Auth plugin for Google sign-in, Apple sign-in. Email/password can stay on Web SDK.
- [ ] **B.2.2** Add Sign in with Apple — **required by App Store for any app that offers third-party social sign-in** (Google). Use `@capacitor-community/apple-sign-in` or the Firebase plugin's Apple support.
- [ ] **B.2.3** ID token retrieval working from Capacitor context for `apiCall`.
- [ ] **B.2.4 — Test:** login as Google, Apple, email — all three succeed in iOS Simulator + on device.

### B.3 — Push notifications via APNs

- [ ] **B.3.1** Install `@capacitor/push-notifications`.
- [ ] **B.3.2** Configure APNs in Apple Developer + Firebase Console (FCM as the delivery layer).
- [ ] **B.3.3** Replace the half-built web push subscription flow with the Capacitor plugin's `register()` → returns FCM token → save via `/api/v1/me/push-subscription`.
- [ ] **B.3.4** Server-side: `web-push` library still works for web users; add FCM Admin SDK send for native tokens. Update notification creators to fan out to both.
- [ ] **B.3.5** Per-event push (closes AUDIT.md 4.2). Wire `mention`, `reply`, `list_invite` first; `like`, `follow` second.
- [ ] **B.3.6 — Test:** trigger each event type from a second account → push arrives on physical iOS device within seconds.

### B.4 — Deep linking (invites + share extension callbacks)

- [ ] **B.4.1** Set up Universal Links (iOS) and App Links (Android). Required for `/invite/[code]` URLs to open inside the app.
- [ ] **B.4.2** Add `apple-app-site-association` and `assetlinks.json` to the `public/` directory.
- [ ] **B.4.3** Capacitor `App` plugin listens for `appUrlOpen` → routes to the right in-app screen.
- [ ] **B.4.4 — Test:** tap an invite link in Messages → opens directly in the app, not Safari.

### B.5 — Native polish

- [ ] **B.5.1** Status bar style, splash screen, app icons (all sizes — use `@capacitor/assets` to generate from a single source).
- [ ] **B.5.2** Configure safe-area insets for notch/dynamic island.
- [ ] **B.5.3** Verify pull-to-refresh feels native (AUDIT.md 3.4 fix should land first).
- [ ] **B.5.4** Disable WKWebView scroll bounce on body if desired (`@capacitor/keyboard` and viewport config).
- [ ] **B.5.5 — Test:** run on a real iPhone 12+ and a real Android device. Feel-check the basics.

---

## Phase C — Share Extension (iOS) + Share Intent (Android)

> **The hero feature.** ~2 weeks. iOS Share Extension is a separate Swift target inside the Capacitor-generated Xcode project — Claude Code can write the Swift, but you should at least skim what it produces.

### C.1 — AI identification backend

- [ ] **C.1.1** `POST /api/v1/identify-movie` — accepts multipart image, returns `{ matches: [{ tmdbId, title, year, mediaType, posterUrl, confidence }] }`.
- [ ] **C.1.2** Pipeline: receive image → resize/compress to ~1024px (cost control) → Claude vision with structured-output prompt asking for `{title, year, mediaType, confidence: 'high'|'medium'|'low'|'unknown'}` → if high/medium, TMDB search by title+year → return top 1-3 matches.
- [ ] **C.1.3** Fallback: if Claude returns `unknown`, try OCR on the image (look for embedded subtitles/title cards) before giving up.
- [ ] **C.1.4** Rate limit per user (use the same limiter from AUDIT.md 3.8).
- [ ] **C.1.5** Auth: require valid ID token. The Share Extension will send its own.
- [ ] **C.1.6 — Test:** curl with 10 sample screenshots from real TikToks/Reels covering: famous Hollywood, recent A24, anime, TV episode, ambiguous still. Verify identification rate and false-positive rate. Tune the prompt until ≥80% top-1 accuracy on the sample.

### C.2 — Shared auth token (App Group)

- [ ] **C.2.1** Set up an App Group in Apple Developer (`group.com.cinechrony.shared`). Enable on both main app and Share Extension targets.
- [ ] **C.2.2** Main app: after Firebase Auth login, write the current ID token to App Group shared `UserDefaults` (or shared Keychain — more secure). Refresh on token rotation.
- [ ] **C.2.3** Share Extension reads token from shared storage.
- [ ] **C.2.4 — Test:** login in main app, verify token visible to extension via debugger.

### C.3 — iOS Share Extension target

- [ ] **C.3.1** Add Share Extension target in Xcode. Configure `Info.plist`:
  - `NSExtensionAttributes.NSExtensionActivationRule` — only activate for `NSExtensionActivationSupportsImageWithMaxCount = 1`
- [ ] **C.3.2** Custom view controller (SwiftUI is fine for iOS 14+ extension UI) showing:
  - Loading spinner while identifying
  - Identified movie card (poster + title + year) with confirm button
  - If multiple matches: pick one
  - List selector (defaults to user's default list, dropdown to switch)
  - "Add" → call `POST /api/v1/lists/[listId]/movies` → success animation → dismiss
- [ ] **C.3.3** Handle the no-identification case gracefully — show "Couldn't identify, search manually?" with a deep-link into the main app's add flow.
- [ ] **C.3.4 — Test:**
  - Real iPhone, real screenshot from TikTok → share → Cinechrony appears in share sheet → identifies → adds → success
  - Same flow with a screenshot of nothing identifiable → graceful fallback
  - Same flow when logged-out → prompts to open the app first

### C.4 — Share confirmation UX polish

- [ ] **C.4.1** Haptic feedback on add success.
- [ ] **C.4.2** Show a 1-second confirmation that mirrors the "saved with @cinechrony" branding — this is the moment users would screenshot to show friends.
- [ ] **C.4.3** Optional: a "share back" button that exports a styled card with the movie poster + "Saved to my watchlist on Cinechrony" — feeds the viral loop.

### C.5 — Android Share Intent handler

- [ ] **C.5.1** Add `<intent-filter>` in `AndroidManifest.xml` for `ACTION_SEND` with `image/*` MIME type → main activity (no separate process needed on Android, unlike iOS extensions).
- [ ] **C.5.2** Capacitor `App` plugin listens for the share intent → reads the image URI → POSTs to `/api/v1/identify-movie` → routes to a confirmation screen in the main app.
- [ ] **C.5.3 — Test:** share a screenshot from Instagram on Android → Cinechrony appears in share menu → flow completes.

### C.6 — PWA Web Share Target (bonus)

- [ ] **C.6.1** Add `share_target` to `public/manifest.json` for Android PWA users who don't install the app.
- [ ] **C.6.2 — Test:** install PWA on Android Chrome, verify share target works.

### C.7 — Onboarding redesign around try-before-signup

> Only buildable once C.1 (`/api/v1/identify-movie`) exists — it reuses that backend at zero marginal cost. This is the "try before you sign up" idea, sequenced correctly. Do NOT build before the hero feature exists; do NOT add a personalization quiz (it changes nothing in the experience — fake-progress anti-pattern).

- [ ] **C.7.1** Replace the static 1.5s logo splash (`onboarding/components/splash-screen.tsx`) with an interactive first screen: "Paste a TikTok/Reel link — see what movie it is" (and, on native, "or share a screenshot"). No auth required.
- [ ] **C.7.2** Wire that screen to `POST /api/v1/identify-movie` (C.1). Show the identified movie card (poster + title + year) — the value reveal — before any signup wall.
- [ ] **C.7.3** Conversion moment: "Sign up to save it to your watchlist" → flows into the existing `signup` → `username` → `import-options` machinery (unchanged).
- [ ] **C.7.4** Pre-signup state: hold the identified movie in local state; after signup completes, auto-add it to the user's default list so the first thing they see is the movie they came for already saved.
- [ ] **C.7.5** Copy reframe on `signup-screen.tsx`: frame signup as "Save your progress," not a gate (cheap; can also be done early via AUDIT.md 4.5).
- [ ] **C.7.6 — Test (manual):** logged-out user pastes a real TikTok link → sees correct movie identified → signs up → lands in app with that movie already in their default list. Also: skip-without-trying path still works.
- [ ] **C.7.7** Optional, last: a one-line stylized founder welcome note on `complete-screen.tsx`. Skip the founder video — over-investment pre-launch.

**Depends on:** C.1 (identify backend), AUDIT.md 4.1 (already-onboarded redirect must be fixed first or returning users hit this flow).

---

## Phase D — App Store + Play Store submission

> ~2-3 weeks including review iterations.

### D.0 — App Store compliance (carried over from the pre-launch audit)

> These are App Store *gate* items — surfaced and partly built during the
> audit (2026-05). Tracked here, not in AUDIT.md, because they're launch
> requirements, not soundness fixes. Status as of 2026-05-20:

- [x] **Account deletion in-app** — already existed (`/settings`); Apple requires it for any app with sign-up.
- [x] **Sign in with Apple** — N/A. App offers only email/password, no third-party social login, so SIWA is not mandated. (If Google/Apple login is ever added, SIWA becomes required — see B.2.2.)
- [x] **AppTrackingTransparency** — N/A. No analytics/tracking SDK in the app.
- [x] **Content reporting (§1.2)** — DONE in the audit: `reportContent` action + Report button on reviews + server-only `/reports` collection.
- [x] **`/privacy` route exists** — built in the audit with an accurate draft. Final legal copy still pending → D.4.1.
- [x] **TMDB attribution** — DONE: shown in `/settings` ("uses the TMDB API but is not endorsed or certified by TMDB").
- [ ] **D.0.1 — Block abusive users (§1.2, REQUIRED before submission).** The Report half is done; Apple also requires a way to *block* a user. Build `blockUser`/`unblockUser` (writes `/users/{uid}/blocked/{blockedUid}`), maintain a client blocked-set, filter blocked authors out of the comments list (and ideally feed + search). Needed before submission, NOT before TestFlight.
- [ ] **D.0.2 — Error monitoring (Sentry).** At launch scale you need to know what's breaking. Sign up, get a DSN, wire `@sentry/nextjs`. ~1h once the DSN exists. (Replaces the audit's "no observability" gap.)
- [ ] **D.0.3 — Moderation contact email** — a published address (e.g. `support@cinechrony.com`) for abuse reports; referenced by the privacy policy and §1.2.

### D.1 — Apple Developer account

- [ ] **D.1.1** Enroll ($99/yr).
- [ ] **D.1.2** Set up team, certificates, provisioning profiles. Xcode → Automatic signing.
- [ ] **D.1.3** Create App ID with the right capabilities: Push Notifications, App Groups, Sign in with Apple, Associated Domains.

### D.2 — App Store Connect setup

- [ ] **D.2.1** Create app record with bundle ID `com.cinechrony.app`.
- [ ] **D.2.2** Upload icon (1024×1024), screenshots (6.7" + 5.5" required; 6.5" recommended).
- [ ] **D.2.3** App description, keywords, support URL, marketing URL, privacy policy URL.
- [ ] **D.2.4** App Privacy questionnaire (Firebase Analytics, push tokens, profile data — declare honestly).
- [ ] **D.2.5** Age rating questionnaire.

### D.3 — TestFlight beta

- [ ] **D.3.1** First TestFlight build. Add yourself + 5-10 trusted testers as internal.
- [ ] **D.3.2** Run for at least 1 week. Collect crash reports, feedback on the share-extension UX specifically.
- [ ] **D.3.3** Iterate. **This is where most of `AUDIT.md` Phase 2 and 3 should be done** — beta users surface what really breaks.

### D.4 — Privacy policy & terms

- [~] **D.4.1** Privacy policy — the `/privacy` route + an accurate draft already exist (built in the audit; reflects real data + third parties). Remaining: a lawyer review of the draft, and confirm the support email. Must address: data collected, third parties (Firebase, TMDB, OMDb, R2), retention, user rights, contact.
- [ ] **D.4.2** Terms of service at `cinechrony.com/terms`.
- [ ] **D.4.3** Both linked from inside the app (Settings → Legal).

### D.5 — App Store review submission

- [ ] **D.5.1** First submission. **Expect at least one rejection** — common reasons for an app like this: account deletion flow not obvious enough, missing demo account credentials for the reviewer, screenshots showing copyrighted movie posters (usually fine but be ready), unclear Share Extension purpose.
- [ ] **D.5.2** Demo account credentials in the App Review notes (with pre-seeded data so reviewer sees the app populated).
- [ ] **D.5.3** Screencast of the share-extension flow attached to review notes — pre-empts the "what does this app do?" question.
- [ ] **D.5.4** Iterate on rejection feedback. Most rejections resolve in 1-2 cycles if you respond fast and clearly.

### D.6 — Google Play submission

- [ ] **D.6.1** Google Play Console account ($25 one-time).
- [ ] **D.6.2** Same asset prep (icon, screenshots, description, privacy policy).
- [ ] **D.6.3** Internal testing track → closed testing → production.
- [ ] **D.6.4** Play's review is faster (often <24h) but they enforce a "must have 20 testers test for 14 days" rule for new developer accounts. Plan around it.

---

## Phase E — Marketing automation

> Can run in parallel with Phase D (App Store review). ~1-2 weeks of setup, then ongoing.

### E.1 — Account setup

- [ ] **E.1.1** Create TikTok account `@cinechrony` (you don't have one yet). Sign up for TikTok Business so the Content Posting API is available.
- [ ] **E.1.2** Convert existing Instagram account to Business (Settings → Account Type). Connect to a Facebook Page (required for Graph API). If no Facebook Page exists, create one.
- [ ] **E.1.3** Create Threads / X / Lemon8 accounts if desired (lower priority).

### E.2 — API access

- [ ] **E.2.1** Facebook Developer app + Instagram Graph API access. Required scopes: `instagram_basic`, `instagram_content_publish`, `pages_show_list`. Long-lived access token stored as env var.
- [ ] **E.2.2** TikTok for Developers app + Content Posting API access. Submit for approval (TikTok reviews API access manually; can take 1-2 weeks).
- [ ] **E.2.3** Test post via each API — manually trigger a Hello-World post to verify auth + permissions before automating.

### E.3 — n8n setup

- [ ] **E.3.1** Choose hosting: n8n Cloud ($20-50/mo) or self-host on a $5 Hetzner VPS. Self-host is fine for solo dev.
- [ ] **E.3.2** Set up basic auth + reverse proxy + HTTPS.
- [ ] **E.3.3** Test a hello-world workflow: HTTP trigger → Claude node → respond.

### E.4 — Remotion templates

- [ ] **E.4.1** Set up Remotion project (`npm create video`).
- [ ] **E.4.2** Build 3 templates initially:
  - **Carousel slides** (10 frames, exported as images for IG carousel)
  - **15-second TikTok/Reel video** (poster + title + reveal, music track)
  - **30-second "Top 5 of the week"** countdown
- [ ] **E.4.3** Deploy as Remotion Lambda (AWS) or local Remotion server. Lambda is easier — pay-per-render.
- [ ] **E.4.4** Test render: pass JSON `{movies: [...]}` to each template, verify output renders correctly.

### E.5 — Content generation pipeline

- [ ] **E.5.1** n8n workflow:
  1. Daily cron @ 9am
  2. Branch by day-of-week (Monday = trending list, Tuesday = "if you liked X", etc.)
  3. Fetch data source: TMDB trending API OR Firestore query (most-added on Cinechrony this week)
  4. Claude node generates structured content: `{caption, slides: [{title, subtitle}], hashtags}` with strict JSON schema
  5. Remotion Lambda render → returns video URL
  6. Notify you on Discord/Slack with the rendered output + "approve to post" button
- [ ] **E.5.2** Approval webhook: clicking approve triggers IG + TikTok posting nodes in n8n.
- [ ] **E.5.3** Failure handling: any step fails → notify you, don't post broken content.

### E.6 — Posting workflow

- [ ] **E.6.1** Instagram: Graph API two-step post (create media container → publish).
- [ ] **E.6.2** TikTok: Content Posting API (publish with caption + hashtags).
- [ ] **E.6.3** Cross-post the same Remotion-rendered video to both, adjusted for aspect ratio (9:16 for both TikTok and Reels — easy).
- [ ] **E.6.4 — Test:** end-to-end dry run a week of content. Verify everything renders + posts. Approve manually for the first month before going fully automated.

### E.7 — Launch sequence

- [ ] **E.7.1** Two weeks before launch: start posting daily to build a back-catalog. Algorithm rewards consistency more than recency.
- [ ] **E.7.2** Launch day:
  - Personal launch TikTok showing the screenshot-to-watchlist demo
  - Automated post highlighting the new feature
  - Reach out to 5-10 movie-TikTok creators with early access codes
- [ ] **E.7.3** Week 1 post-launch: respond to every comment manually. Algorithm boost.
- [ ] **E.7.4** Track: install rate, share-extension usage, retention day 7. If share-extension usage < 30% of installs, the demo isn't selling — iterate copy.

## Critical dependencies (read before starting)

1. **`AUDIT.md` Phase 1 happens DURING Phase A.** When you refactor each action to an API route, add `verifyCaller()` to that route. The two efforts converge.
2. **Phase A is the long pole.** It's 2-3 weeks of careful refactoring. Everything else assumes it's done.
3. **Phase C depends on Phase B.** Share Extension lives inside the Capacitor iOS project.
4. **Phase E can run fully parallel** with B, C, D. No technical dependencies.
5. **TestFlight (D.3) is the moment to fold in `AUDIT.md` Phase 2 and 3.** Beta users surface real breakage; don't try to ship the audit in isolation.

## Realistic timeline (solo dev, focused)

| Week | Primary work | Parallel |
|------|--------------|----------|
| 1-2 | Phase A.1-A.3 (server actions refactor + auth) | — |
| 3 | Phase A.4-A.5 (client migration + static export) | E.1-E.2 (account setup) |
| 4 | Phase B (Capacitor wrap) | E.3 (n8n) |
| 5-6 | Phase C.1-C.3 (Share Extension + AI) | E.4-E.5 (Remotion + pipeline) |
| 7 | Phase C.4-C.5 (Android share + polish) | E.6 (posting workflow) |
| 8 | Phase D.1-D.3 (TestFlight + iterate) | Audit Phase 2-3 in TestFlight |
| 9 | Phase D.5-D.6 (App Store submission) | E.7 (back-catalog content) |
| 10 | Apple review iterations | — |
| 11 | **Launch** | — |

~**11 weeks** if everything goes smoothly. Add 2-4 weeks of buffer for Apple review cycles + Swift learning curve + the unexpected.
