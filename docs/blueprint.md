## Style Guidelines:

- Background: Beige/Paper texture (#F4F1EA) for a tactile feel.
- Primary color: A bold, saturated blue (#2962FF) to evoke a youthful, retro feel, contrasting well with the beige background.
- Accent color: A vivid yellow (#FFEA00), analogous to the blue, to highlight interactive elements, drawing from arcade aesthetics.
- Headings: 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif for a thick, chunky, retro look. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Body: 'Space Mono' monospace for a clean, coding-inspired feel. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Lucide React icons for a consistent and simple visual language.
- Cards, buttons, and inputs: 3px solid black borders (border-3 border-black) on everything, with slight rounded corners (rounded-md or rounded-lg) and hard, non-blurred drop shadows (box-shadow: 4px 4px 0px 0px #000).
- Buttons translate down to cover the shadow on click, mimicking a physical press.
